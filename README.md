# AutoEncoderDecoder-
This project handles the creation of an autoencoderdecoder algorithm which had as input an image and as output an image. It took into consideration 2 Convolutional Neural networks with one of them representing the  Encoder which compresses the image and the second representing the Decoder which decompresses the output of Encoder.
